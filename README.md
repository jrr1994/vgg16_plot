Produce the histogram of feature maps and weights at layers 1-5 of pretrained vgg-16 for an example input image.
**vgg16_plot.py** implements 4 part: features maps visualization, feature maps histogram, kernel(weight) visualization and weight histogram.
**input_images** folder is for our inputs.
**feature_maps folder** is our outputs for feature maps, including feature maps visualization and feature maps histogram.
**weight_images folder** is our outputs for weights, including kernel(weight) visualization and weight histogram.
